## Data Availability
The success of our Q&A system hinges on the availability of relevant data. To ensure we have what we need, we must first explore whether the necessary datasets are accessible online. If suitable datasets aren't available, we have the option to generate our own data. 

Fortunately, we can utilize tools like GPT-4o-mini for this purpose. My goal in generating data is not only to become proficient in data creation but also to prepare for scenarios where data may be scarce or unavailable.

Since ChatGPT was not able to provide complete data, you can use the provided sample CSV structure to create additional entries as needed. 


## Data Cleaning 
![Data Cleaning Example](1-3.png)

Now that we have defined the columns in our dataset, the next step is to tackle any issues that arose during data creation. I encountered several problems that were not effectively resolved using Python, so I decided to use Microsoft Excel for data cleaning.

To organise the data more effectively, I added a category column and saved each file under category names, such as `card.csv`, `children.csv`, and so on. I then concatenated these files to create a comprehensive CSV file containing a total of 637 rows. Each entry can be accessed [data-each-category](../data/dataset-all.csv).


### Modifications Made

- **Column Adjustments:**
  - Removed the **id** column entirely to streamline the dataset.
  - Introduced a **gameId** column to uniquely identify each game entry.
  - Eliminated the **indoorOutdoor** column, as it was redundant and interfered with the category column.

- **Data Validation:**
  - Checked for blank values across the dataset:
    - For **Alternate Names**, replaced empty entries with `None`.
    - For **PlayersMax**, marked any missing values as `Not specified`.
  
- **Duplicate Removal:**
  - Conducted a thorough check to identify and remove duplicate entries, ensuring uniqueness while excluding the **gameId** column.

- **Data Integrity:**
  - Deleted rows lacking values in the **ageRange** field, as this information is crucial for categorizing games appropriately.

### Final Data 

Following a thorough data cleaning process, the final dataset has been refined to **590 rows**, ensuring both accuracy and relevance. You can access the finalized data [here](../data/game-dataset.csv).
