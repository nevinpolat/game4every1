### Why Combining Them Is Better

By integrating the LLM with the knowledge base:
- **Accuracy**: The knowledge base provides correct and up-to-date information.
- **Clarity**: The LLM explains answers in an approachable way.
- **Reliability**: Reduces the chances of incorrect answers since the LLM uses exact data from the knowledge base.

#### An Example

- **Just Asking the LLM**:
  - **You**: "What's a good game for 10-year-olds?"
  - **LLM**: "Maybe try 'Super Fun Game.'" (Could be a made-up game.)

- **Using Both Together**:
  - **You**: "What's a good game for 10-year-olds?"
  - **LLM checks the knowledge base and finds 'Hide and Seek.'**
  - **LLM**: "You could play 'Hide and Seek.' It‚Äôs a fun game for 10-year-olds where one person counts while others hide!"

In summary:
- The knowledge base serves as a **fact-checker**, ensuring information accuracy.
- The LLM acts as a **storyteller**, presenting information in an engaging way.
- Together, they provide correct answers with a friendly approach.
