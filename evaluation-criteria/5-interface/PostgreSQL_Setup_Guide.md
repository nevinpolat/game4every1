# PostgreSQL Setup Guide

## Installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu

To begin, follow these steps to install PostgreSQL on your Ubuntu system:

1. **Update the Package Index**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install PostgreSQL**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
   ```

3. **Start the PostgreSQL Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql start
   ```

4. **Access the PostgreSQL Prompt**:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ```

### Summary

These commands will help you install and start PostgreSQL, allowing you to access the command line for further database management.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create a New User

Next, while still in the PostgreSQL prompt, create a new user for your application:

```sql
CREATE USER game_u WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
```

### 2. Create a New Database

Then, create a new database named `game_db` and assign ownership to the newly created user `game_u`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE game_db OWNER game_u;
```

### 3. Connect to the Database

After creating the database, connect to it as the `game_u` user:

```sql
\c game_db
```

Alternatively, you can log in directly from the terminal:

```bash
psql -U game_u -d game_db
```

### 4. Create the Users Table

Now that you're connected to the `game_db` database, create the `users` table with the specified fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(20),
    registration_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Summary of the Steps

1. **Create User**: `game_u`
2. **Create Database**: `game_db` (owned by `game_u`)
3. **Connect to Database**: Switch to `game_db` as `game_u`
4. **Create Users Table**: With fields `user_id`, `user_name`, `age`, `gender`, and `registration_time`

## Creating Tables and Managing Privileges

Next, you can manage access to the `users` table by setting privileges.

### Granting Privileges to Users

To allow other users to access the `users` table, you can grant specific privileges. For example, to give the `game_u` user all privileges on the `users` table, run:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON users TO game_u;
```

### Checking Privileges

To verify which privileges a user has on the `users` table, you can run:

```sql
\dp users
```

### Revoking Privileges

If you need to revoke privileges from a user, use the following command:

```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON users FROM some_other_user;
```

## Conclusion

Finally, following these steps will set up a user, a database, and a users table in a secure and organized manner. This approach adheres to best practices for managing privileges and ensuring the right level of access for users in PostgreSQL.
