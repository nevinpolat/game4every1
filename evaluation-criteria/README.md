# Project: Interactive Game Instructor Assistant

## Project Overview
The Interactive Games Instructor Assistant is a comprehensive tool designed to help instructors, educators, team leaders, and event organizers select and organize games tailored to specific needs. Leveraging a rich dataset of over 600 unique games, the assistant integrates advanced retrieval methods and a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide intelligent recommendations. The system features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit and employs Python Script for automated data ingestion, ensuring that the knowledge base remains up-to-date and relevant.  


## Evaluation Criteria Addressed

1. [**Well-Described Problem**](./1-problem-description/problem-description.md)  
   The project addresses the need for an efficient way to select a problem and set the application based on various criteria, enhancing user engagement and tailored outcomes.

2. [**Knowledge Base and LLM in RAG Flow**](./2-RAG-flow/RAG-flow.md)  
   Utilizes a structured knowledge base (game database) and a Language Learning Model (LLM) (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to provide informed responses to user queries.

3. [**Multiple Retrieval Approaches Evaluated**](./3-retrieval-evaluation/retrieval-evaluation.md)  
   Implements both text-based and vector-based retrieval methods, evaluating their effectiveness to select the optimal approach.

4. [**Multiple RAG Approaches Evaluated**](./4-RAG-evaluation/RAG-evaluation.md)  
   Explores different strategies for integrating retrieval with the LLM, selecting the most effective one for generating accurate recommendations.

5. [**Interface UI with Streamlit**](./5-interface/interface.md)  
   Features an interactive web-based UI developed using Streamlit, enabling users to input queries and receive game recommendations seamlessly.

6. [**Automated Ingestion with Python**](./6-ingestion-pipeline/ingestion-pipeline.md)  
   Employs Python scripts for automated data ingestion, ensuring that the game dataset is regularly updated and processed without manual intervention.

7. [**Best Practices**](./7-best-practices/best-practices.md)  
   Implements document reranking and hybrid search with key metrics. 

8. [**Monitoring User Feedback**](./8-monitoring/monitoring.md)  
   Collects user feedback and visualizes it through a dashboard featuring at least five charts, providing insights into application performance and user satisfaction.

9. [**Containerization**](../README.md#day-9-docker-integration-smooth-sailing-with-docker-compose)  
   For the main application, a Dockerfile is provided to build a standalone Docker image, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment. Additionally, Docker Compose is utilized for managing application dependencies, simplifying the setup and deployment process by defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

10. [**Complete Implementation Guide**](../README.md#day-10-reproducibility)  
    This comprehensive implementation guide provides all necessary steps and code snippets to set up the system effectively. By following this guide, you can deploy a robust tool that enhances the game selection process for various educational and organizational settings.

11. [**Deployment to Streamlit Cloud**](../README.md#day-11-game4every1-in-streamlit-cloud)  
    Elevate your application by deploying it to Streamlit Cloud, where accessibility meets scalability, ensuring that the app is available globally with minimal setup.



# Conclusion
The Interactive Games Instructor Assistant seamlessly integrates automated data ingestion, advanced retrieval methods, and an intuitive user interface to provide tailored game recommendations. By leveraging both structured queries and semantic searches within a RAG framework, the assistant ensures that users receive the most relevant and engaging game suggestions based on their specific requirements.
